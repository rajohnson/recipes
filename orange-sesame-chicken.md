Start cooking rice.

Place broccoli florets into a steamer or colander set over a pan of boiling water. Cover and steam for 5 mins, or until cooked through and vibrant green; set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, water, sesame oil, brown sugar, vinegar, ginger, garlic, sesame seed, and 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch.

Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; sprinkle with remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch until evenly coated.

Heat canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Working in two batches, add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes. Stir in soy sauce mixture until thickened, about 2-3 minutes.

Serve on top of rice.
