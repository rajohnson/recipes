# Thai Basil Chicken

- Rice
- ½ cup chicken stock
- 3 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 ½ tablespoons light brown sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Onion, thinly sliced in strips
- 2 bell peppers, thinly sliced in strips
- 1 ¼ pounds ground chicken breast
- 1 ½ cups packed fresh basil leaves

Start cooking rice.
In a small bowl, whisk together chicken stock, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar and vinegar.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, onion and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
Add ground chicken and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the chicken as it cooks; drain excess fat.
Stir in stock mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in basil until just wilted, about 30 seconds.
Divide rice into bowls. Top with chicken mixture.
Serve immediately.
