# Cowboy Caviar

## Dressing
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 fresh lime (2 Tbsp juice)
- 1/2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar

## Other ingredients
- 1 15oz. can black beans
- 1 15oz. can black eyed peas
- 1 bell pepper (any color)
- 2 Roma tomatoes
- 1 jalapeño
- 1/4 red onion 
- 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro 
- chips

In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 2 Tbsp of juice from the lime, balsamic vinegar, chili powder, cumin, salt, and sugar.

Rinse and drain both cans of beans in a colander. Once well drained, transfer them to a large bowl.

Finely dice the bell pepper, tomatoes, jalapeño, and red onion. Try to dice the vegetables into pieces that are roughly the same size as the beans. For a less spicy salad, scrape the seeds out of the jalapeño before dicing. Roughly chop the cilantro.

Add the chopped vegetables to the bowl with the beans.

Pour the dressing over the salad, then stir until everything is well coated. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to eat.
